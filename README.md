The Internet Speed Test Application is a graphical user interface (GUI)-based tool developed in Python using the Tkinter library and the Speedtest-cli module. This application allows users to measure and monitor their internet connection's download and upload speeds in real time. Its simple and intuitive interface makes it easy for both technical and non-technical users to use and understand their internet performance.

Techniques, Tools, and Libraries:
Tkinter: A built-in Python library for developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Tkinter was used to create a simple interface that includes buttons, labels, and dynamic result updates.
Speedtest-cli: A Python library that interfaces with Speedtest.net to check internet speed. It provides functionalities to measure download speed, upload speed, and ping.
